# Personal Website

I am a PhD student and the project lead for BisQue, an open source NSF funded project in the UCSB Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. My research is centered around two main areas:

  - Computer Vision and machine learning applied to Biomedical, Materials Science, and Biology
  - Building large web-scale Machine Learning systems for image and video processing
 
If you are interested in joining the BisQue Team, we are always looking for motivated students so feel free to reach out.
